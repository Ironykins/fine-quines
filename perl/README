A Quine written in Perl

Perl is a hackable mishmash of programming concepts bundled into a high-level scripting language. It has been in use since the late eighties.

Perl is expressive. If there's one way to write something in Perl, there are at least a thousand different ways to write the same thing. Programming styles in Perl tend to vary greatly from person to person.
