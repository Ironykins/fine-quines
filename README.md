# Fine Quines

This repo contains a small collection of Quines in a variety of languages.

I assembled these for an art showcase. Using [asciinema](https://github.com/asciinema/asciinema) I recorded terminal sessions compiling and running a series of quines to demonstrate what they were. The recorded sessions play on a loop on a computer monitor set up at the gallery, with a small accompanying blurb offering further explanation of what quines are.

## Credits

Most of these Quines were shamelessly stolen from [Gary Thompson's Quine Page](http://www.nyx.net/~gthompso/quine.htm). 

I wrote the Haskell and Javascript quines myself. Consider that code public domain, and anyone is free to copy or modify it without attribution.

None of the other Quines had any associated license information.

Since these are Quines, it's hard to include attribution information in the source files themselves, so I will attempt to give it below.
