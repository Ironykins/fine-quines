A Quine written in C

C is one of the oldest, most widely used, and most loved and hated programming languages in existence. Most operating systems are written primarily in C.  

It is powerful, nuanced, and well understood. C programs are blazingly fast and often require a lot of hardware-level knowledge to properly debug.

Programming in C is as beautiful and terrible as freedom itself. The programmer is assumed to be an expert, and is responsible for anything and everything that can go wrong.
